## My process

- Created semantic HTML first
- Created CSS selectors to:
  - create custom variables to contain the various colours, font sizes font weights used in the design
  - used a CSS reset
  - layout the design using Flexbox
  - style the various elements, adding in hover states for the buttons and link
  - added in `:focus` styling for accessibility purposes
  - create a different width layout for mobile version

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow (responsive design)
- Google Font

### What I learned
